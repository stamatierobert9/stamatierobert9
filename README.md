👋 Hi, I’m Robert! I'm a passionate programmer and a dedicated Formula 1 enthusiast. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Polytechnic Bucharest.

👀 Programming has always captivated me, and I constantly seek opportunities to delve into new technologies and enhance my skills. I enjoy exploring different programming languages and frameworks, and I'm particularly interested in web development and data analysis.

🏫 At the University of Polytechnic Bucharest, I'm gaining a solid foundation in computer science principles and honing my problem-solving abilities. I'm actively involved in various coding projects, both individually and collaboratively, to broaden my practical knowledge and build robust applications.

💻 In my GitHub repositories, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my programming journey. From web applications to data visualization tools, I love to experiment and implement innovative solutions. I believe in writing clean and efficient code while following best practices.

🏁 Aside from programming, I'm an avid follower of Formula 1. The speed, technology, and strategy involved in the sport captivate me. I enjoy analyzing race data, studying car designs, and keeping up with the latest developments in the Formula 1 world.

📫 If you're interested in collaborating on a project or discussing programming and Formula 1, feel free to reach out to me at stamatierobert9@gmail.com. I'm always open to exciting opportunities and collaborations that can help me grow as a programmer and Formula 1 enthusiast.
